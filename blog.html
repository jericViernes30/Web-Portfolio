            <p id="def">
              A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and
              outgoing network traffic and permits or blocks data packets based
              on a set of security rules. Its purpose is to establish a barrier
              between your internal network and incoming traffic from external
              sources (such as the internet) in order to block malicious traffic
              like viruses and hackers.

          <div class="about">
            <h1 id="work">How does a firewall work?</h1>
            <p id="work-def">
              Firewalls carefully analyze incoming traffic based on
              pre-established rules and filter traffic coming from unsecured or
              suspicious sources to prevent attacks. Firewalls guard traffic at
              a computer’s entry point, called ports, which is where information
              is exchanged with external devices. For example, “Source address
              172.18.1.1 is allowed to reach destination 172.18.2.1 over port
              22."
            </p>
            <p id="work-def-2">
              Think of IP addresses as houses, and port numbers as rooms within
              the house. Only trusted people (source addresses) are allowed to
              enter the house (destination address) at all—then it’s further
              filtered so that people within the house are only allowed to
              access certain rooms (destination ports), depending on if they're
              the owner, a child, or a guest. The owner is allowed to any room
              (any port), while children and guests are allowed into a certain
              set of rooms (specific ports).

            <h1 id="setup">How to configure a firewall?</h1>
            <h2 id="step1">STEP 1: Secure your firewall</h2>
            <p id="proc1">
              If an attacker is able to gain administrative access to your
              firewall it is “game over” for your network security. Therefore,
              securing your firewall is the first and most important step of
              this process. Never put a firewall into production that is not
              properly secured by at least the following configuration actions
            </p>
            <h2 id="step2">
              STEP 2: Architect your firewall zones and IP addresses
            </h2>
            <p id="proc2">
              In order to protect the valuable assets on your network, you
              should first identify what the assets are (for example, payment
              card data or patient data). Then plan out your network structure
              so that these assets can be grouped together and placed into
              networks (or zones) based on similar sensitivity level and
              function.
            </p>
            <h2 id="step3">Step 3: Configure access control lists</h2>
            <p id="proc3">
              Now that you have established your network zones and assigned them
              to interfaces, you should determine exactly which traffic needs to
              be able to flow into and out of each zone. This traffic will be
              permitted using firewall rules called access control lists (ACLs),
              which are applied to each interface or subinterface on the
              firewall. Make your ACLs specific to the exact source and/or
              destination IP addresses and port numbers whenever possible. At
              the end of every access control list, make sure there is a “deny
              all” rule to filter out all unapproved traffic. Apply both inbound
              and outbound ACLs to each interface and subinterface on your
              firewall so that only approved traffic is allowed into and out of
              each zone.
            </p>
            <h2 id="step4">
              Step 4: Configure your other firewall services and logging
            </h2>
            <p id="proc4">
              If your firewall is also capable of acting as a dynamic host
              configuration protocol (DHCP) server, network time protocol (NTP)
              server, intrusion prevention system (IPS), etc., then go ahead and
              configure the services you wish to use. Disable all the extra
              services that you don’t intend to use.
            </p>
            <h2 id="step5">Step 5: Test your firewall configuration</h2>
            <p id="proc5" style="margin-bottom: 20px">
              In a test environment, verify that your firewall works as
              intended. Don’t forget to verify that your firewall is blocking
              traffic that should be blocked according to your ACL
              configurations. Testing your firewall should include both
              vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. <br />
              Once you have finished testing your firewall, your firewall should
              be ready for production. Always remember to keep a backup of your
              firewall configuration saved in a secure place so that all of your
              hard work is not lost in the event of a hardware failure.
